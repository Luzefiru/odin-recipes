# odin-recipes
A basic recipe website in accordance with The Odin Project's HTML Foundations Course Project.

This project taught me how to utilize Git, HTML, and GitHub Pages to setup a simple website that contains images, hyperlinks to local webpages, and nested lists with various HTML attributes.

I also learned various HTML attribute etiquette/conventions to enhance website accessibility and compatibility. Furthermore, I was able to practice creating 'atomic commits' and use Git commit conventions to keep track of my development process.
