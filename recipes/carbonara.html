        <p class="description">Carbonara is an Italian pasta dish from Rome made with eggs, hard cheese, cured pork and black pepper. The dish arrived at its modern form, with its current name, in the middle of the 20th century.<br><br>
        The cheese is usually <em>Pecorino Romano</em>, <em>Parmigiano-Reggiano</em>, or a combination of the two. Spaghetti is the most common pasta, but <i>fettuccine</i>, <i>rigatoni</i>, <i>linguine</i>, or <i>bucatini</i> are also used. Normally <i>guanciale</i> or <i>pancetta</i> are used for the meat component, but lardons of smoked bacon are a common substitute outside Italy.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) package spaghetti</li>
            <li>12 slices thick-cut, applewood-smoked bacon</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
            <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>2 large cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>¼ cup dry vermouth</li>
            <li>1 cup shredded Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>½ cup whipping cream (Optional)</li>
            <li>4 eggs, beaten</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon ground black pepper</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes.</li><br>
            <li>Meanwhile, place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels. Reserve 2 tablespoons bacon fat in the skillet and discard the rest. Chop bacon when cool enough to handle.</li><br>
            <li>Add 1 tablespoon olive oil and onion to reserved bacon fat in the skillet. Cook over medium-high heat until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Pour vermouth into the pan and bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits of food off the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon, about 1 minute. Mix in chopped bacon.</li><br>
            <li>Drain spaghetti, transfer to a large serving bowl, and mix in remaining 1 tablespoon oil. Add bacon-onion mixture, Parmesan cheese, cream, eggs, and pepper to the hot pasta; stir until spaghetti is well coated and sauce is creamy.</li><br>
        </ol>
